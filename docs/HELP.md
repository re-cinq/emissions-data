# Help Wanted

In order to keep getting more and more accurate estimations, our base data needs
to be kept up to date and accurate.

We are using the TEADS methodology to calculate our coefficients, however the
dataset was only created for AWS EC2 instances

In order for us to try to keep things as accurate we need the following:

- [Help with our GCP Dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ssNDqDfmpCzTw2JYbhXu5BQ0BLhnAVstbX2r5b1HfTw/edit?usp=sharing)
    - This includes getting access to baremetal servers using the various types
      of CPUS that GCP uses in order to run
      [turbostress](https://github.com/teads/turbostress), you can find which
      CPUs (or CPUs in the same family group) in the linked dataset
- Starting an Azure dataset (that is identical to the AWS and GCP datasets)
- [Updating the AWS dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dkbdT0nUngTCPas5cvLYh7-I_8H6vqXOvwTlvonFhYI/edit?usp=sharing) (Note we have made a copy of the TEADS dataset for our updates)
- Verifying our Methodology (This will be posted soon)

If you or anybody you know can help with this, please feel to reach out on
Github
